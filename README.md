# Project: PACMEN

Whats the purpose? I have not quite figured it out yet. But if you love watching tons of packmen bounce around a screen like the screensaves of old, then you came to the right place!

## How-To Run

There is not much to say here:

- Download the code from Github
- Click the `Start Game` button
- Click the `Add PacMan` button in the upper left as many times as you would like.

## Roadmap

There is a few bugs and improvements I would like to make to this code.

Improvements:

- Make the pacmen face in the direction they are bouncing and have their mouths open and close
- Make the pacmen bounce off one another

Bug Fixes:

- If you keep hitting the `Start Game` button, the Pacmen on the screen start speeding up. However any newly added Pacmen get added at a slower speed.
- The Pacmen adding is not smooth - when you add Pacmen before starting the game, all added Pacmen jump to random locations.
